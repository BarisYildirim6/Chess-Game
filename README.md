# Chess-Game
This is a classic chess game project. We as two intermediate level chess players wanted to develop our own chess game.<br>
Other than classic chess, there are also different chess game modes such as:<br>
- Bullet (1 min)<br>
- Blitz (3-5 min)<br>
- Rapid (10-15 min)<br>
- Casual (20+ min)<br>
